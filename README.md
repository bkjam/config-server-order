# Development with Centralized Configuration Server

This is my exploration to play around with the configurations in Spring Boot and Spring Cloud Config Server.

## Usage

1. Start Config Server

   ```bash
   ./gradlew config-server:bootrun
   ```
   
2. Start Config Client
    
   ```bash
   ./gradlew config-client:bootrun
   ```
